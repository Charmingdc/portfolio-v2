# Charmingdc Portfolio 🚀

## Description
A premium, motion-driven portfolio designed to showcase software engineering expertise with a focus on performance, accessibility, and clean aesthetics. This project serves as a digital headquarters, highlighting a diverse range of technical tools—from frontend frameworks like React and TypeScript to backend integrations with Firebase and Supabase.

The application leverages high-performance animations and a modular architecture to provide a seamless user experience across all devices.

## Features
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: Built on Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.
- 🎨 **Fluid Animations**: Sophisticated motion design using `motion/react` with custom presets for consistent transitions.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Mobile-first design implementation using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- 🔍 **SEO & Metadata**: Pre-configured with robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and comprehensive Open Graph tags for social media visibility.
- ♿ **Accessibility First**: Includes "Skip to main content" links, semantic HTML, and respect for `prefers-reduced-motion` system settings.
- 🛠️ **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with custom hooks for data fetching (`useProjects`) and UI logic (`useMotionPresets`).

## Usage

This portfolio is structured into two main views: the **Main Page** (Landing) and the **Projects Page**.

- **Navigation**: Use the fixed navbar to return home or click on individual project cards to see a deep dive into the technical details.
- **Project Exploration**: The `ProjectOverview` component dynamically renders details based on the project ID/Name, showing technologies used, live URLs, and a dedicated image gallery.
- **Interactivity**: Hover over social icons or project cards to see smooth scaling effects and staggered entrance animations.
- **Accessibility**: Use the `Tab` key to navigate. A "Skip to main content" link will appear for keyboard users to bypass the navigation.
